Thank you to all developers for your attention and anticipation of this project! Currently, the core code of the project is still undergoing final optimization, debugging, and documentation improvement, and it will be released soon.​
If you have urgent usage needs at present, you can implement the relevant functions in advance through the following temporary solutions:​

Our NMKE Knowledge Editing Framework is improved based on the Alphaedit implementation in the [EasyEdit repository](https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit). 

For requirements related to neuron attribution, you can directly use the neuron-attribution (https://github.com/zepingyu0512/neuron-attribution). It is compatible with the core attribution logic of this project and can seamlessly connect with the subsequent open-source code.​

If you need further technical guidance, please feel free to leave a message via the Issue section of the project repository, and we will provide support for you in a timely manner!
